# Real-time-GHF
A real-time extension of the generalized Hartree Fock (GHF) method, based on the algorithm presented in _ _Ding, F.; Goings, J. J.; Frisch, M. J.; Li, X. Ab initio non-relativistic spin dynamics. J. Chem. Phys. 2014, 141, 214111. DOI: 10.1063/1.4902884._ _

`rt_ghf.py` is the main RT-GHF class. `h_atom.py` and `li_atom.py` are example scripts, both of which are from Ding et al. `h_mag_05.png` and `li_mag.png` are the output graphs for the scripts. 

At the time of this update, the hydrogen atom example matches Ding et al., while the lithium atom example does not.
